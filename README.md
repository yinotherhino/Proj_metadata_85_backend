# Xtracto - A web app to Fetch metadata

## Product Brief 
Xtracto is an easy-to-use software that collects, displays, and allows users to edit the metadata of different uploaded files, helping them manage their digital assets better. From images, PDFs, CSV, and JSON file types, the platform also goes beyond metadata extraction to enable users to convert file types, and resize content to fit their requirements.

Xtracto would serve as a seamless platform that empowers users to control how metadata is managed within the organization. This metadata extraction and editing tool would improve how companies search for and find their assets, increase document security, improve data governance, improve data rights management, and aid regulatory compliance.

## Research Background 
In its most simplified sense, metadata is data about other data. It is a small bit of information that defines a broader sense of data, and an invaluable resource for gaining complete control of your data and digital file ecosystem.

The main purpose of metadata is to make tracking essential data faster and easier. Thatâ€™s why it is often used to organize and remodel complicated data into a practical and clear form.

Without metadata, finding the right files would be virtually impossible as it adds structure to a file and assigns values, such as a case ID, classification, or keywords, that makes it easier to find. 

## Use Cases : Metadata Extraction and Editing
### Individual/ Creative Use:
Extracting metadata from file types like images, videos, or audios can help you avoid piracy and copyright infringements on those digital assets. A product like Brand Folder enables users to upload images and documents to extract the metadata from these files.

### Enterprise Use: 
Extracting these metadata makes it easier for enterprises with huge repositories of digital assets to find the files they need, whether it's for marketing, sales, support, or legal purposes. The tool also helps with protecting sensitive documents, improve digital rights management through metadata tags, and aid regulatory compliance during auditing. Tools like Exiftool and PhotoMe enable enterprises to do this.

A tool like MetaGooFil also protects organizations from attackers by scouring the internet looking for documents that belong to your target organization and downloads them in an attempt to extract useful metadata.

## Problem statement
Despite the impact of already existing tools for metadata extraction, there are still challenges that make it difficult for users to effectively utilize these tools. 

From user expectations of the product versus the reality of how complex some tools are to navigate. To user adoption, then organizational implementation.

Despite its many advantages, some of the data extraction tools end up subpar on user experience, making it a challenge for users to maximally utilize these tools. 

## Product Features
Besides its simple and seamless user experience, Xtracto would include (but not limited to) the following features to enable users to effectively utilize it. 

A landing page, allowing site visitors to understand what the webapp can do, and how to navigate it. 

A Sign in and Sign Up page to allow users create and manage their profiles and documents on the webapp.

An About page to give further insight on Xtracto's work and mission. 

A Contact page to enable users access support when the need arises.

A Dashboard to give users control and access to the platform. This is where user files can be uploaded, extract or edit metadata, save, export, share website embed, or download files, etc.

    
## Bottlenecks to Product Development
A major bottleneck the team might experience in the development and deployment of this product would be the time constraint, and the timeframe for development is limited, and poses a challenge as regards, software testing, indepth research, or including further features that might be advantageous to users.

Another constraint due to the limited time is the lack of adequate user research and profiling for this software. Users cannot be directly contacted or interviewed with insights from that interview being a contributor to how the product is built. Secondary research, like internet search, has been the primary source of information for this work.

Because of the source of information guiding this development, the product might not meet the empathetic needs of the user. As at the time that this document is being written, a user persona has not been created for this product due to the limited information. So this product would be built without the full understanding of the user's pain points. 


## Summary

The Xtracto webapp is designed to simplify metadata extraction, editing, and management, making it as flexible and seamless as possible for users to navigate. 

The product will also include features that allow users convert and resize uploaded files, giving them control of how their assets are managed and utilized.
