                Product Brief
            </h6>
            <p class="docs-body">
                Xtracto is an easy-to-use software that collects, displays, and allows users to edit the metadata of different uploaded files, helping them manage their digital assets better. From images, PDFs, CSV, and JSON file types, the platform also goes beyond metadata extraction to enable users to convert file types, and resize content to fit their requirements.
                Xtracto would serve as a seamless platform that empowers users to control how metadata is managed within the organization. This metadata extraction and editing tool would improve how companies search for and find their assets, increase document security, improve data governance, improve data rights management, and aid regulatory compliance.

                Research Background
            </h6>
            <p class="docs-body">
                In its most simplified sense, metadata is data about other data. It is a small bit of information that defines a broader sense of data, and an invaluable resource for gaining complete control of your data and digital file ecosystem.
                The main purpose of metadata is to make tracking essential data faster and easier. That's why it is often used to organize and remodel complicated data into a practical and clear form.
                Without metadata, finding the right files would be virtually impossible as it adds structure to a file and assigns values, such as a case ID, classification, or keywords, that makes it easier to find. 
                
            </p>

            <h6 >
                Usecases
            </h6>
            <p class="docs-body">
                Individual/ Creative Use: Extracting metadata from file types like images, videos, or audios can help you avoid piracy and copyright infringements on those digital assets. A product like Brand Folder enables users to upload images and documents to extract the metadata from these files.
                Enterprise Use: Extracting these metadata makes it easier for enterprises with huge repositories of digital assets to find the files they need, whether it's for marketing, sales, support, or legal purposes. The tool also helps with protecting sensitive documents, improve digital rights management through metadata tags, and aid regulatory compliance during auditing. Tools like Exiftool and PhotoMe enable enterprises to do this.
                A tool like MetaGooFil also protects organizations from attackers by scouring the internet looking for documents that belong to your target organization and downloads them in an attempt to extract useful metadata.
