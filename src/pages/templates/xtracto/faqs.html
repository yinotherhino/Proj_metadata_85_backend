        What is Metadata? <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-right faq-drop faq-drop-1"></i>
        <p class="drop-faqs">
            Metadata is data about other data. It is a small bit of information that defines a broader sense of data, and an invaluable resource for gaining complete control of your data and digital file ecosystem. 
            The main purpose of metadata is to make tracking essential data faster and easier. That's why it is often used to organize and remodel complicated data into a practical and clear form.
            Without metadata, finding the right files would be virtually impossible as it adds structure to a file and assigns values, such as a case ID, classification, or keywords, that makes it easier to find.
